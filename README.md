## Features

### /dashboard
If you don’t have a Studyplan selected, Mate will be there to greet you 🤖<br>
Clicking its card takes you straight into the [chat](#chat) — and if you hit the button directly, it throws in a precooked prompt.

You'll also see a list of Studyplans you can pick from or save any of them for later.

### /chat
Here you will be interacting with Mate, your helpful and friendly virtual assistant 👾<br>
Ask him—in a polite way—to create a new Studyplan for you, help you with your tasks, give you study tips or just chat with him.

He knows what's your current Studyplan, which day you're on and what's your progress so feel free to ask him how to continue with your Studyplan or how to complete your tasks 🪄

### /studyplan
This is what Studymate is all about. Here you can start, manage and complete your Studyplans.

Studyplans are the core of Studymate. They are created by Mate, and you can ask him to create a new one for you.
They are a list of lessons, one for each day of its duration.
Each one of these lessons has a list of tasks which you will have to complete every day in order to complete the Studyplan 🎉

There's a card for the current day's lesson, and a list of all the lessons and tasks of the Studyplan regardless of the day so you know what's to come.

<small>📜 Remember that you can ask Mate to create a new Studyplan for you, or just select an existing one in the [dashboard](#dashboard).</small>


### /studyplan/tasks

Here you can see the general goal of the day and a list of tasks to complete. Click on any of them to start working on it.

Mate will also be there to help you with your tasks, you can ask him to explain the task or just give you a hint.

Once you have completed all the tasks, Mate will congratulate you and you'd be free to enjoy your well deserved rest 🎉

![The tasks page, showing the user's tasks for the current day](/public/screenshots/studyplan-tasks.webp)
<small>🎯 You can access this page by clicking on the "Today's Lesson" card in the [Studyplan](#studyplan) page.</small>

### /studyplan/focus

This page is meant for you to *focus* and complete your tasks. There's a timer to help you stay focused and a list of tasks to complete.

On the bottom of the page you'll find a card with swapable tasks, here you can mark your task as done or swap it if you want to complete another one first 😌


![The focus page, showing the user's tasks for the current day](/public/screenshots/focus.webp)
<small>⚠️ This page is still under development. You can complete your tasks, but the timer and settings menu are not functional yet.</small>


### /profile
Here you can see your info, statistics and achievements. You'll also find lists of your saved and completed Studyplans.

Reach a high streak, collect trophies 🏆 and flex your grind

## How it works

### Studyplans

Every Studyplan is created by Mate, which means that they start being private inside your chat.
If you choose to start or save it, it will become anonymously public and other users will be able to see it in their [dashboards](#dashboard).

When you start a Studyplan, you actually get a copy of the Studyplan in your [Studyplan](#studyplan) page, so the public Studyplan remains intact.

Studymate is not a social media, so this is the only interaction you'll have with other users.


## Local Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Create your local env file from the template:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local # Windows
cp .env.example .env.local # Unix
```

3. Fill in your own keys in `.env.local`:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Future Additions

StudyMate is still in development and will keep getting updates — all of its content will still be free, of course.
